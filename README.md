## Typescript
**TypeScript** is a typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language. It compiles to plain JavaScript, making it compatible with any JavaScript code.

### Why TypeScript?
**Improved code reliability**:Early detection of potential errors through type checking.
**Enhanced code readability**: Clearer code structure and intent due to explicit types.
**Better tooling support**: IDEs and code editors offer advanced features like autocompletion, refactoring, and navigation.
**Large-scale application development**: Manageable codebase for complex projects.
### Core Concepts
**Types**: Define the structure and values of variables.
**Basic types**: number, string, boolean, null, undefined, any, void, never.
**Complex types**: arrays, objects, tuples, enums, interfaces.
**Interfaces**: Define the shape of an object.
**Classes**: Create reusable blueprints for objects.
**Modules**: Organize code into reusable units.
**Generics**: Write reusable components that work with different types.
